<h1>E-commerce Project Backend</h1><br>
This repository contains the source code for the backend of an e-commerce project, developed using Node.js and SQLite. The goal is to provide basic user authentication and management functionalities, allowing users to register, log in, and update their information.

üìã Features

User Registration: Allows new users to sign up with their name, email, and password.

Login: Users can authenticate using email and password, receiving a JWT token.

User Information Update: Authenticated users can update their personal details.

Route Protection: Sensitive routes are protected by authentication, ensuring only logged-in users can access them. <br>

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.

Express: Web framework for building APIs quickly and efficiently.

SQLite: Lightweight, embedded database, ideal for development and prototyping.

JSON Web Token (JWT): Used for user authentication.

dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file to keep configuration secure. <br>
